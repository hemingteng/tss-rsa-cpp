# tss-rsa-cpp

![img](doc/logo.png)

This software implements a library for tss-rsa.

The library comes with serialize/deserialize support to be used in higher level code to implement networking.

# Prerequisites

- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl#documentation). See the [OpenSSL Installation Instructions](./OpenSSL-Installation.md)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git). See the [Protocol Buffers Installation Instructions](./Protocol-Buffers-Installation.md)
- [crypto-bn-cpp](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-bn-cpp.git). See the [crypto-bn-cpp Installation Instructions](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-bn-cpp/blob/main/README.md#build-and-install)
- [crypto-hash-cpp](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-hash-cpp.git). See the [crypto-hash-cpp Installation Instructions](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-hash-cpp/blob/main/README.md#build-and-install)
- [crypto-encode-cpp](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-encode-cpp.git). See the [crypto-encode-cpp Installation Instructions](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-encode-cpp/blob/main/README.md#build-and-install)
- [crypto-curve-cpp](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-curve-cpp.git). See the [crypto-curve-cpp Installation Instructions](https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-curve-cpp/blob/main/README.md#build-and-install)

# Build and Install

Linux and Mac are supported now.  After obtaining the Source, have a look at the installation script.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/safeheron/crypto-tss-rsa-cpp.git
cd crypto-tss-rsa-cpp
mkdir build && cd build
# Run "cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=Your-Root-Directory-of-OPENSSL" instead of the command below on Mac OS.
cmake ..
# Add the path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on Mac OS; Ignore it on Linux
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/
make
make test
sudo make install
```

More platforms such as Windows would be supported soon.


# To start using crypto-tss-rsa-cpp

## CMake

CMake is your best option. It supports building on Linux, MacOS and Windows (soon) but also has a good chance of working on other platforms (no promises!). cmake has good support for crosscompiling and can be used for targeting the Android platform.

To build crypto-tss-rsa-cpp from source, follow the BUILDING guide.

The canonical way to discover dependencies in CMake is the find_package command.

```shell
project(XXXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release")

find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(PROTOBUF REQUIRED protobuf)  # this looks for *.pc file
#set(OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS TRUE)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
find_package(CryptoTSSRSA REQUIRED)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} XXXX.cpp)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
        ${CryptoTSSRSA_INCLUDE_DIRS}
        ${PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIRS}
        )

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
        CryptoTSSRSA
        OpenSSL::Crypto
        ${PROTOBUF_LINK_LIBRARIES}
        pthread )
```
